# The Bloom Protocol

Ji-Hoon adjusted the sterilization hood’s frayed elastic under his chin. The algae in the petri dish pulsed faintly, a bioluminescent shiver across its surface. He’d spliced his sister’s genome into the strain himself, using the CRISPR she’d left behind in her lab notes. The protocol was simple: encode her memories into nucleotides, let the algae’s neural network process them, decode the output.  

He’d tried twelve times.  

This batch smelled different. Sour, like overripe mangoes. Maybe the growth medium needed less glucose. Or more. He jabbed the data probe into the dish. The screen flickered, then resolved into a grainy video feed.  

Not memories.  

A child’s laughter. His mother’s voice, *“Ji-Hoon, don’t touch that—“* Static cut through, then a man’s face filled the screen. Strangers. A birthday cake with candles shaped like the Korean alphabet. His sister’s handwriting, looping across a notebook: *“If this works, I’ll be everywhere and nowhere.”*  

He yanked the probe free. The algae convulsed, splattering the hood. When he looked back, the screen displayed coordinates. A map.

The address led to a defunct florist’s shop in Incheon. Behind the moth-eaten curtains, rows of hydroponic troughs glowed under LED lights. Algae. All of it encoded. A woman emerged from the back, her arms streaked with chlorophyll stains.  

“You’re the brother,” she said. “She talked about you.”  

He recognized her from the video. The man too, now standing by the door, his hands calloused from handling vats.  

“They’re not just memories,” the woman said, dipping a finger into a trough. The liquid shimmered. “She designed the protocol to evolve. Every time it replicates, it… interprets.”  

Ji-Hoon’s throat tightened. “So the data isn’t static?”  

“Neither are we,” the man said.  

Outside, rain began to fall. The shop’s sign creaked in the wind: *Forever Gardens*.

Back in his garage, Ji-Hoon stared at the petri dish. The algae had spread into fractal patterns, edges creeping toward the lid. He’d deleted the coordinates from his phone, but the sequence lingered in his mind.  

He wondered if she’d intended this. If the self-replication was a flaw or a feature.  

The screen lit up again without him touching it. A new file.  

*“Ji-Hoon,”* her voice said, clear now. *“Don’t mourn the backup. Grown things die. But they leave seeds.”*  

He reached for the probe. Hesitated.  

The algae kept growing.
