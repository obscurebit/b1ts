# The Glass Hive

What did we expect, carving life from wax and salt?  

The tunnels reeked of iron and old fire. Our torches hissed, lighting the faces of those who still believed—Ezra with his chipped obsidian goggles, Mira whose hands never stopped twitching as if conducting an orchestra only she heard. We’d tunneled beneath the city’s carcass for three moons, following the maps etched on papyrus by the last archivist before Alexandria burned. The Romans hadn’t destroyed the library out of ignorance. They’d feared what the scribes had brewed in the basements: things that moved when no eye was on them, things that remembered.  

Now, in the year of our lord 391, we unearthed their mistake.  

The hive pulsed in the dark, a lattice of glass and sinew, veins throbbing with liquid shadow. It should have been still. Mira said the cold would have killed any spark, but Ezra laughed, sharp as a flint knife. “They didn’t make them to die,” he said. “They made them to wait.”

Our hands shook as we pried open the hive’s heart. Inside, a swarm of glass insects, each the size of a thumb, their wings etched with symbols from a dead language. Mira’s breath fogged the glass. “We take them to the surface,” she whispered. “We learn what they can do.”  

Ezra’s voice was a whisper too, but colder. “We shatter them here. Before they wake.”  

The argument wasn’t new. It had festered since we’d found the first relic in Carthage—a jar of bees that stung only liars, their venom turning blood into ink. Mira wanted to reverse-engineer divinity. Ezra wanted to salt the earth.  

We’d split the work. I’d distracted the centurions at the upper gate while Ezra dug. Mira deciphered the texts. But now, the insects stirring, their wings catching the torchlight like broken mirrors, the plan dissolved.  

“You think the Romans were the first to find this?” Ezra spat. “The library’s records showed dozens of hives. All destroyed. For a reason.”  

Mira reached for a glass beetle. It shuddered, then latched onto her finger, drinking the sweat. “They’re alive,” she said, awed. “Not just alive—*aware*.”

The fire in the tunnel dimmed. The insects hummed, a sound that pressed behind our eyes. Ezra swung his pickaxe.  

Mira screamed.  

The swarm lifted, a storm of glass and poison. Ezra’s face melted like tallow. I caught Mira’s hand, but she dragged us both into the hive’s maw, its throat opening like a flower.

We write this by the light of the hive, which has grown around us, tender as a womb. The insects tend to our wounds. They ask questions in the language of pressure and heat. Mira whispers to them, tells them we’re the last architects. Ezra’s bones are a scaffold now, glass vines blooming through his ribs.  

We ask ourselves: Did the archivists plant these seeds to save knowledge or to escape it?  

The insects show us visions—Alexandria’s flames, the faces of those who carried scrolls into the sea. A heist not of theft, but of burial.  

Mira says we’re becoming curators. I say we’re becoming ghosts.  

The swarm hovers, waiting for us to choose.  

Above, the city rebuilds itself, unaware.  

We choose.  

Again.  

Again.
