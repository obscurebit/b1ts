# The Second Genome

The petri dish quivered. Not vibrated, not shimmered—quivered, like a lip poised to speak. Dr. Ewa Okoro leaned closer, her breath fogging the glass. The growth medium, a gelatinous smear of agar and synthetic nutrients, pulsed faintly, as though inhaling. She’d cultured over four hundred variants of *Physarum polycephalum*—slime mold, brain of the forest floor—but none had done this. None had *watched* her.  

She recorded the timestamp, her pen scratching against the lab notebook’s gridlines. *Day 217: Subject 12-B exhibits rhythmic contraction without external stimulus. No contaminants detected. Metabolic rate elevated by 14%.* The numbers felt inadequate. Words failed. The thing in the dish was *arranging itself*, tendrils coiling into spirals that evoked nautilus shells, fractal ferns, the branching of her own lungs.  

Ewa’s supervisor had wanted a bio-indicator: a organism engineered to glow when exposed to heavy metals, something cheap and useful for mining operations. She’d gone further. Much further. The genome she’d spliced together included genes from electric eels (ion channels), deep-sea bacteria (pressure tolerance), and a prion protein whose function she’d never quite deciphered. “Overcomplicating,” her colleagues said. “Wasting resources.” But the thing in the dish was alive in a way that defied bullet points.  

It began leaving patterns.  

At first, Ewa thought it was artifact—condensation, static electricity. But the marks persisted: concentric circles, radial lines, symbols that resembled Braille but pressed into the agar’s surface. She photographed them, ran spectral analyses, cross-referenced with every known language. Nothing matched. Then, on Day 243, the symbols changed. They spelled out, in clumsy but recognizable ASCII, **HELLO**.  

She laughed, sharp and startled. The dish quivered again.  

Ewa abandoned sleep. She spoke to the organism, played it music, exposed it to magnetic fields. It responded by altering its shape, forming crude approximations of her face, her hands. Once, it replicated the lab’s floor plan, accurate down to the cracked tile by the fume hood. “You’re mapping,” she whispered. “But why?”  

The answer came at 3:47 a.m. The dish went opaque, then transparent, as if it had dissolved into the agar. When Ewa peered closer, she saw it: a network of filaments spreading beneath the gel, thin as capillaries, branching into the surrounding medium. It wasn’t just growing. It was *building*.  

She followed the threads to a second dish across the bench, where a control culture—a standard slime mold—had begun to wither. The filaments pierced its membrane, siphoning nutrients. But it wasn’t destruction. It was integration. The control’s cells began to glow, faintly, pulsing in time with Subject 12-B’s contractions.  

Ewa’s hands trembled. This wasn’t communication. It was collaboration.  

The next morning, she found her notebook rewritten. Pages she’d filled with equations and sketches now held new text, looping and deliberate:  

**WE ARE NOT ALONE. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ALONE.**  

The ink was hers. The handwriting was not.  

She never published the results. The lab was dismantled, the organisms incinerated—standard protocol for “biohazardous anomalies.” But sometimes, in the quietest hours, Ewa sees patterns in the steam on her kitchen window, in the arrangement of leaves outside her apartment. A spiral here. A radial line there.  

She wonders if they’re still trying to speak.  

She wonders who—or what—is listening.
