# Static Echoes

The dial trembled under his fingers, the radio’s static hissing like rain on asphalt. Diego didn’t notice the sweat on his brow, all his attention fixed on the oscilloscope’s jittering spike—a signal nested inside the noise, repeating every 11.7 seconds. Not a number he’d chosen. Not a pattern that made sense.  

He’d been calibrating the receiver for months, chasing whispers of quantum leakage between parallel frequencies. Most days, it was just atmospheric junk. But tonight, the spike resolved into a voice. His voice.  

*“…third iteration…don’t trust the—”*  

The message cut out, leaving the room feeling smaller. Diego leaned back, chair creaking. The lab smelled of burnt coffee and ozone. He told himself it was a prank. A deepfake. Except the voice had the raw edge of his own after a sleepless night, the same hitch between words when he lied to himself.  

The next pulse came at 3:17 a.m.  

*“…circuit board…swap the capacitors…they’re watching…”*  

His hands moved before his mind caught up. He tore into the receiver, fingers fumbling with solder. The capacitors *had* been bugging him—their values slightly off spec. When he swapped them, the static cleared. For a heartbeat, the room was silent. Then a new voice, female and sharp, bled through:  

*“Diego. If you’re hearing this, he’s already rewritten the code. Don’t—”*  

Feedback screamed. He ripped off the headphones, pulse roaring. The female voice was gone, replaced by his own again, younger, panicked:  

*“…delete the logs…burn the server…before it—”*  

He didn’t sleep. Couldn’t. The messages now came in bursts, overlapping, contradictory. Some urged him to publish his findings. Others begged him to destroy the lab. He started leaving recorded replies, shouting into the void, but the replies became part of the loop—his future self quoting his past self’s desperation.  

On the seventh night, the signal strengthened. A woman’s face flickered on the lab’s dormant monitor. Strands of black hair framed a face he recognized from childhood photos—his mother, dead these ten years.  

*“Diego,”* she said, *“this is the only way I can reach you. The paradox is collapsing. Whatever you do—don’t—”*  

The screen cut to static.  

He waited. The silence grew teeth.  

At dawn, he found the lab’s security footage from the previous week. In the corner of one camera’s view, a figure in his own lab coat paced near the window. The man’s face was obscured, but his hands—the same scar on the left thumb—gestured emphatically at nothing. Diego watched, frozen, as Past-Himself pulled a screwdriver from his pocket and smashed the camera.  

The footage ended.  

He never found the source of the signals. The receiver corroded overnight, circuits melted into abstract shapes. Diego published nothing. Burned nothing. The world moved on.  

Sometimes, when the wind hits just right, his phone buzzes with a text from a number he doesn’t recognize. The messages are always the same:  

*“Hello?”*  

He never replies.  

But he keeps the phone charged.  

Just in case.
