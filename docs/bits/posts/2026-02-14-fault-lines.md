# Fault Lines

The streetlight flickered in a seven-blink cadence: on, off, on, off, on, off, then a pause before repeating. Eko counted each cycle as he waited at the crosswalk, his sneakers soaked through from the puddle that hadn’t been there yesterday. The bakery across the street now sold *artisanal jam tarts* instead of *fresh baguettes*, though the awning remained the same faded blue. He’d passed this corner every morning for three years.  

“You see that?” said a woman’s voice. She stood beside him, holding a paper cup of coffee that smelled like burnt sugar. Her name was Mira, though he didn’t know this yet.  

“The light?” Eko nodded.  

“Not just the light. The whole block. It’s… stuttering.”  

They watched a cat slink between parked cars, its shadow detaching briefly to walk backward before dissolving. Mira’s hand trembled as she raised the cup to her lips.  

Eko’s phone buzzed. A notification from the weather app: *Heavy rain expected at 7:03 PM*. But the sky was clear, stars already piercing the dusk. He showed her.  

“Same here,” she said. “But mine says *sunny*.”  

They compared phones. Different weather, same time stamp. Different phone models, different carriers.  

The crosswalk signal changed. They stepped into the street, and the world hiccupped.  

For a moment, the bakery was a bookstore. Then a laundromat. Then back to jam tarts. Eko’s ears popped. Mira gasped—a scar had appeared on her wrist, thin and silver, as if from a childhood injury she couldn’t remember.  

“You felt that, right?” he said.  

“Like a glitch in a video game.” She laughed, sharp and nervous. “Except we’re the pixels.”  

They followed the flickering lights westward, where inconsistencies thickened. A man on a bicycle rode past, his face blurring like a smudged drawing. A graffiti mural of a phoenix melted into a math equation. The air hummed with a frequency just beyond hearing.  

In an alley, they found the source: a humming box bolted to the wall, its surface rippling like water. Wires snaked from it into the ground, into the sky.  

“Maintenance hatch?” Mira speculated.  

“Or a patch.” Eko reached out. His fingers passed through the surface, and for a heartbeat, he saw the code—a river of numbers and symbols, frantic corrections scrolling sideways. Déjà vu hit him so hard he staggered. This was the third time he’d lived this minute.  

Mira yanked him back. “Don’t.” Her voice was grim. “I’ve seen people… dissolve trying to touch it.”  

“How do you know all this?”  

“I don’t.” She pulled a folded map from her coat, dotted with scribbled Xs. “But others do. Or did. They leave notes in the glitches.”  

They traced the map to a 24-hour diner on the edge of town. The waitress knew them by name, though neither had been there before. Their booths were always “reserved.”  

Over coffee that tasted like cinnamon and static, Mira explained: the city was a simulation, probably corporate, definitely failing. The glitches were error messages. The déjà vu? “The system rebooting mid-loop,” she said. “We’re just… lucky enough to notice.”  

Eko’s hands shook. “What happens when it crashes?”  

She shrugged. “Maybe we reset. Maybe we disappear.”  

Outside, the streetlights flickered in unison, a morse code plea. Or a warning.  

They parted at dawn, exchanging numbers written on napkins that might or might not vanish. Eko walked home through streets that shifted beneath his feet, the sky cycling through a dozen wrong colors.  

He never saw Mira again.  

But sometimes, when the power flickers just so, he finds pages torn from her map in his mailbox, annotated in her looping script. *They’re watching the hatch on 5th*, one reads. *Don’t trust the rain*.  

He keeps a notebook now, documenting inconsistencies. The number of stairs in his building fluctuates. His neighbor’s cat has six toes on Tuesdays.  

Last week, his phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: a photo of the alley, the maintenance box glowing faintly. The caption read: *It’s spreading*.  

Eko deleted the picture.  

But he saved the napkin.  

It’s in his wallet, next to a subway token from a city that doesn’t exist.
