# The Silent Archive

“You shouldn’t be here,” she said.  

The orderly’s shoes squeaked on the linoleum, a sound like wet bread being torn. Clara didn’t turn. Her fingers stayed curled around the rusted key she’d pried from the matron’s desk. “Neither should you,” she replied. “Visiting hours ended an hour ago.”  

He grunted. A shadow with a nametag. *Reginald*. The kind of man who’d report her for stealing sugar cubes from the nurses’ station. She slipped the key into her apron pocket.  

**Vignette 2**  

Basement stairwell. Air thick with mildew and the metallic tang of old blood. Clara counted steps—thirty-seven down—to the door marked *Janitorial Storage*. The key bit into the lock. Inside, shelves of dusty bottles labeled in cursive Latin. Behind them, a wall panel warped by humidity. She pressed it. It swung open.  

Not a room. A throat.  

Stairs spiraling deeper. The air here smelled of petrichor and machine oil. Her flashlight caught symbols etched into the walls—circles swallowing triangles, serpentine glyphs that coiled when she stared too long. No electrodes, no wires. Just stone, cold and singing.  

**Vignette 3**  

The crow arrived on her third descent. Black as a priest’s collar, one eye milky, the other sharp enough to cut. It perched on a ledge, watching. Clara offered a scrap of peppermint from her pocket. The bird took it, then tilted its head. A sound like gravel in a tin can—laughter?  

“You know this place?” she asked.  

It hopped closer. A tag hung from its leg, tarnished silver. She leaned in. Engraved: *Property of the Institute for Civilized Antiquities, 1923*. The year her mother vanished. The year they bulldozed the old cemetery to build this hospital.  

**Vignette 4**  

Reginald found her in the supply closet, x-rays in hand. “Those are confidential,” he said, breath reeking of peppermint schnapps.  

Clara held up the film. A spine twisted like a question mark. Not human. “What’s buried under this building, Reggie?”  

He blanched. “Put it back. They’ll lock you up. Again.”  

She smiled. “Too late.”  

**Vignette 5**  

The crow led her to a chamber. The walls pulsed—not with light, but memory. Faces pressed against the stone, features dissolving like sugar in rain. They whispered in a language that hurt her teeth. The crow cawed. The vision snapped shut.  

A child’s doll lay in the corner, porcelain face cracked. Clara’s fingers brushed it. The floor yawned open.  

**Vignette 6**  

They came at dawn. White coats, black suits. Reginald among them, eyes downcast. The matron held a syringe like a communion wafer. “You’ve been unwell, Clara. Hallucinations. Paranoia.”  

She spat. “You’re sitting on a tomb.”  

The crow dive-bombed, wings clipping the matron’s head. Chaos. A needle broke on the floor.  

**Vignette 7**  

Now the basement stairs end at a concrete wall. The key is useless. The crow visits her room, leaves twigs on the windowsill. Sometimes a feather.  

Clara sews them into her mattress.  

At night, the walls hum—not with sound, but the weight of what’s silent.  

The doll’s face stares from her drawer, waiting.  

Reginald brings her meals now. Always peppermint. Always looking away.
