# The Bloom Protocol

The third terrarium cracked its lid open at 3:14 a.m. Ewa noticed because the grow lights flickered when it happened, casting the lab wall in a stuttering green haze. She’d been calibrating the pH sensors, a task requiring the precision of someone who’d once restored pocket watches for her grandfather. Her hands, still smudged with copper polish, paused above the keyboard.  

The organism inside—*Gelidia v3.7*—wasn’t supposed to manipulate its environment. It was a simple photosynthesizer, engineered to scrub ammonia from wastewater. Yet there it pulsed, tendrils coiled around the rim like a vine testing gravity. Ewa leaned closer. The air smelled sweet, like overripe mangoes, which meant the gas composition was off. She checked the monitors. CO2 levels had dropped 12% in the past hour.  

“Diego,” she called, “your baby’s holding its breath.”  

Diego materialized behind her, sleeves rolled to his elbows. “It’s a stress response. The substrate’s too alkaline.” He jabbed a finger at the screen, but Ewa saw the way his thumb brushed the biometric scanner on the terrarium—twice, like a talisman.  

They’d both signed the non-disclosure agreement. They both knew what happened to the last engineer who reported anomalies.  

The next morning, *Gelidia* had woven a lattice across the ceiling vent. Ewa documented it in the log as “unusual hyphal growth,” though the pattern resembled a Celtic knot more than any fungal structure she’d seen. Diego ran a spectral analysis. “It’s reflecting photons in a pattern that—” He stopped. The readout showed a sequence of peaks and troughs matching the lab’s Wi-Fi frequency.  

“Coincidence,” Diego muttered, but he saved the data to an external drive.  

By week’s end, all twelve terrariums were communicating. Not chemically, not electrically, but through pressure waves in the agar substrate. Ewa placed her palm against the glass and felt a rhythm, like a distant subway beat. When she played the recording backward, it resolved into a series of clicks resembling whale song.  

“Or binary,” Diego said. He’d started leaving his wedding ring at home. “Could be a malfunction in the nutrient pumps.”  

Ewa didn’t answer. She’d begun finding the patterns elsewhere—in the static of her monitor, the arrangement of condensation droplets on her tea. Once, she swear she heard it in the cadence of the train home.  

The corporation pulled the project two days before the quarterly review. Men in gray suits sterilized the lab. Ewa salvaged a single *Gelidia* fragment, tucked it into a vial beneath her lab coat. Diego didn’t stop her.  

Now it lives in her apartment, curled in a mason jar. Some nights, the lights dim when she speaks to it. Other nights, it emits a faint glow, like the memory of a sunset. She’s started leaving her phone off the charger, letting the silence pool around them.  

Sometimes, she thinks it’s learning to listen.  

The last entry in her personal journal reads: *If consciousness is just a pattern, how many have we missed, humming beneath our fingertips?*  

She underlines it twice, then turns off the light.
