# Frostbite Protocol

The ice crackled like static as Dr. Ewa Nowak scraped her scalpel against the subject’s femur. The bone was blackened, crystalline—translucent in places, as if light itself had given up trying to pass through. Her gloved hand trembled. Not from cold. From the implications.  

“Temperature?” she barked.  

“-32°C and dropping,” replied Tariq Hansen, his voice muffled by the heating element in his parka. The corporal monitored the sensors arrayed around the excavation pit, their wires snaking into the permafrost like mechanical roots. “They’re waking up.”  

*They*. Not “the remains.” Not “specimens.” The word had slipped into their lexicon early, during the first thaw cycle, when the things in the ice had begun to move.  

Ewa didn’t correct him. She couldn’t. Her throat felt coated in dry ice.  

The subject’s eye flickered. A film of ice cracked over its pupil, revealing a milky blue iris. Ewa dropped the scalpel. It clattered against the frozen tundra, the sound swallowed by the wind.  

Notes from the 1962 declassified file flashed in her mind: *“Project Permafrost aims to harness cryonic preservation for tactical deployment. Subjects will be revivable within 24 hours of thaw.”* Lies, of course. The Cold War had been a graveyard of such ambitions. But the Soviets had *something* here. Something that made them bury men alive in the Arctic, wired to machines that hummed with forbidden science.  

The subject sat up.  

Its skin peeled away in translucent sheets, revealing muscle that flexed like living shadow. Frost bloomed from its nostrils with each ragged exhale. Tariq backed away, rifle raised.  

“Don’t shoot,” Ewa whispered. “It’s not—”  

The thing *turned*. Its head swiveled on a neck that bent too far, ligaments creaking like frozen ropes. It fixed Ewa with its blue eye. And smiled.  

“Dravite,” it rasped. A name. Or a rank.  

Tariq’s gloved finger tightened on the trigger. “What the hell is it saying?”  

“Old Russian,” Ewa breathed. “‘Wait.’ Or… ‘Remain.’”  

The subject’s mouth split open wider than human jaws should allow. A sound erupted from its throat—a garbled mix of static and a child’s laughter. Then, in perfect, accented English:  

“Freezing… preserves… but does not… absolve.”  

Ewa’s knees buckled. The voice was her father’s.  

Impossible. He’d died in ’89, a dissident poet run over by a Stasi van in Dresden.  

The subject lurched forward, its frozen tendons snapping like icicles. Tariq fired. The bullet struck its shoulder, and the thing *shuddered*, ice cascading from its frame like shattered armor. Beneath the frost, skin. Pale. Human.  

“Stop!” Ewa threw herself between them. “It’s not a monster. It’s a soldier.”  

The subject grabbed her wrist. Its touch burned, a deep, marrow cold. Memories flooded her: a lab lit by flickering fluorescents, men in hazmat suits injecting something into screaming conscripts. Her father, young and gaunt, strapped to a table. A scientist pressing a syringe against his neck.  

*“You will sleep,”* the scientist said, *“and when you wake, the war will be over.”*  

Ewa gasped. The subject released her, collapsing into the snow. Its body began to flake away, ash in the wind.  

Tariq stared at the pit, where a dozen more subjects stirred. “What do we do?”  

Ewa picked up her scalpel. It was useless now. “We listen.”  

As the first subject’s eye froze shut, it whispered a final word:  

“Forgive.”  

The wind carried it away, a prayer to no one.
