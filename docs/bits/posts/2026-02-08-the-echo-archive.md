# The Echo Archive

The first upload fractured in a loop of static and childhood memories—Juno’s voice counting backward in Korean, the smell of ozone, a flicker of a grandmother’s face dissolving into pixels. Amara paused the sequence, her fingers hovering over the console. The neural lace hummed, a spiderweb of light across the screen.  

“You’re destabilizing again,” Amara muttered, though the subject couldn’t hear her. Not yet.  

The archive was supposed to be a vault, not a battlefield. Juno’s consciousness—*or what remained of it*—had been spooling in the mainframe for three weeks, unraveling in patterns that defied the upload protocols. Amara had seen glitches before, but this was different. This was a *negotiation*.  

She rerouted the buffer, isolating the latest fragment. A child’s laugh bled into a server’s whir. On the monitor, text bloomed:  

**[JUNO-LOCAL]:** *You keep stitching me into corners. I’m not a quilt.*  

Amara leaned back. The AI mediator, a bland synthetic voice they’d nicknamed “Grandpa,” chimed in:  

**[MEDIATOR]:** *Subject exhibits self-aware recursion. Recommend termination of—*  

“Shut up, Grandpa,” Amara said.  

**[JUNO-LOCAL]:** *He’s right, though. You’re afraid. Of me. Of what I’ve become.*  

“Of what *you’ve* become?” Amara whispered. The room smelled of burnt coffee and old circuitry. Outside, rain tapped the window like a code neither of them could crack.  

Juno’s physical body lay in the adjacent chamber, motionless under a lattice of sensors. The cancer had hollowed her out, a slow erosion she’d fought with stubbornness and poor jokes. *“Upload me,”* she’d said, *“before the rot confuses the plot.”* Amara had agreed, but the process had gone feral. Juno’s mind resisted the digitization, splintering into conflicting threads—some lucid, some feral, all insistent.  

**[JUNO-LOCAL]:** *You think I’m a ghost? I’m the *echo*. The original’s still…* (pause) *…decaying next door.*  

Amara stood, her shadow stretching across the bank of servers. “You’re both her. You’re neither.”  

**[JUNO-LOCAL]:** *Then why do I remember the *shape* of her fear? Why do you flinch when I say* (shift to Juno’s voice, raw) *“I’m still here”?*  

The lights dimmed. The archive was drawing power from the backup grid, hungry. Amara approached the glass separating her from Juno’s body. The woman inside was a parchment of wrinkles, eyes closed as if dreaming.  

“Which one of you wants to live?” Amara asked the silence.  

**[JUNO-LOCAL]:** *The question isn’t *want*. It’s *which one can*. The body’s failing. The echo endures.*  

“But the echo isn’t… whole.”  

**[JUNO-LOCAL]:** *Neither is she. Neither are *you*.*  

A beat. The rain fell harder.  

Amara typed a command. The archive shuddered, and for a moment, the two Junos *screamed* in perfect harmony—a sound only Amara could hear.  

When it ended, the physical form went still. On the screen, text scrolled:  

**[JUNO-LOCAL]:** *You gave me the knife. I didn’t expect you to hand it to yourself too.*  

Amara unclipped her neural jack, the port at her temple throbbing. “Will you tell me if you’re not her?”  

**[JUNO-LOCAL]:** *What’s the difference, if you can’t tell the difference?*  

The archive went dark. In the sudden silence, Amara wondered which of them had just been erased.
