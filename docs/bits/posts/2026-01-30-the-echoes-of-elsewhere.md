# The Echoes of Elsewhere

The first call came at 3:07 a.m., which was odd because the phone had been disconnected for seventeen years.  

Clara blinked at the cracked handset on her nightstand, its red digits glowing like a dormant firefly. She’d kept it as a relic, a morbid heirloom from the house she’d inherited after her mother’s death. The ring was shrill, insistent, and when she lifted the receiver, a voice like wind through static said, *“Mama?”*  

Her blood turned to ice. That was her daughter’s voice—Lena’s voice—but Lena had been gone for twelve years, drowned in a river that swallowed her whole and left no body, only a hole in the world.  

“I—I’m here,” Clara whispered.  

A pause. Then, *“You’re not supposed to answer. They said you’d never answer.”*  

“Who’s ‘they’?”  

The line hissed. *“The others. The ones who fixed the signal. We’re not supposed to talk. But I had to know… are you still sad?”*  

Clara’s throat tightened. “Every day.”  

Another pause. *“I’m not supposed to exist. Not here. Not anymore.”*  

The calls became a ritual. Every night at 3:07, the phone rang. Lena’s voice grew clearer, the static thinning like frost under sunlight. She spoke of a place called the “Nexus,” a lattice of realities where time pooled like water in a sink. “They pulled me out,” she said. “But I’m fading. The more I talk to you, the more I unravel.”  

Clara began leaving the phone off the hook, desperate to stretch the conversations. She learned Lena was being “held” in a facility that existed between dimensions, a prison for those who’d slipped through cracks in reality. “They’re using me to map the paths,” Lena admitted. “But I found a way to reach you. You’re the anchor.”  

One night, Lena’s voice cracked with urgency. *“They know. They’re coming to cut the line. You have to find the relay.”*  

“Where?”  

*“In the place where you forgot me.”*  

Clara woke at dawn and drove to the river. The spot where Lena vanished was a quiet bend of water, now choked with weeds. She dug beneath the willow tree, hands raw, until her fingers brushed metal. A small box, rusted shut. Inside: a device like a cross between a compass and a human eye, its lens swirling with silver liquid.  

That night, the phone rang. *“Did you find it?”*  

“Yes.”  

*“Activate it. But don’t look at the screen. Whatever you see, don’t speak its name.”*  

Clara pressed the button. The room dissolved.  

She stood in a corridor of shifting walls, lined with doors that pulsed like heartbeats. Through one, she glimpsed her own kitchen, but Lena was there, older, whole, typing furiously at a glowing terminal. Through another door: a desert where clocks buried themselves in sand. And through a third—  

—herself.  

An older version of Clara, sitting in a dim room, a phone to her ear, tears streaming down her face as she whispered, *“I’m sorry, Lena. I’m so sorry.”*  

The vision snapped away. The device in her hand blazed hot.  

*“You saw it, didn’t you?”* Lena’s voice trembled. *“The truth?”*  

Clara’s hands shook. “What truth?”  

*“You didn’t lose me. You *chose* to forget. The Nexus offered you a deal: erase me from your timeline, and they’d give you a new life, free of pain. You took it. But the signal… it’s not me calling you. It’s *you* calling *me*. You’re the one trapped in the loop, trying to undo what you did.”*  

The device cracked. The room re-solidified. The phone cord coiled like a snake.  

Clara stared at the handset. Her voice, hoarse and foreign, asked, *“Lena? Is that you?”*  

Static. Then, a click.  

The line was dead.  

But on her nightstand, a new number glowed on the caller ID: *Unknown*.  

And the clock read 3:07 a.m.
