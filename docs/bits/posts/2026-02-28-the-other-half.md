# The Other Half

The scent of fresh earth clung to the air, sharper than the usual sweetness of cut grass. Renzo paused his push mower, wiping his brow with a rag. At the cemetery’s edge, a man in a gray suit stood too still, facing a plot where the headstone read *Eleanor Voss, 1921–1953*. Renzo had trimmed around that stone a hundred times. Today, the name felt like a mistake.  

He finished the lawn by 11:47, as always. The clock tower’s chime carried over pinewoods. At 11:52, the man in gray sat on a bench, produced a silver coin, and flipped it. Renzo saw this from his shed window. The coin hung in the air, spinning without falling. Sunlight slanted through it, casting a shadow that moved independently—a jagged thing, like broken glass.  

At 11:59, the coin dropped. The man pocketed it and walked toward the oaks. Renzo followed, dust clinging to his boots.  

The man didn’t turn. “You hear it too, then.” His voice was dry, a file folder closed tight.  

“Hear what?”  

“The split. Like a wire stretched too tight.” He handed Renzo the coin. It was warm, ordinary, until Renzo’s thumb brushed the edge. A jolt. A vision: the same cemetery, but the headstones bore different names. *Eleanor Voss* was gone. In its place: *Renzo Calderón, 1920–1954*.  

The man lit a cigarette. “I’m him, over there. Or was. You?”  

Renzo swallowed. “I don’t know.”  

“They’ll come for you now. They always do.” The man exhaled smoke that coiled into a shape like a question mark. “Knowing changes the equation. You start... branching.”  

At noon, the world shivered. Not a flicker, not a glow—just a hesitation, as if the air had forgotten how to be air. Renzo’s vision blurred. When it cleared, the man was gone. The bench faced *Renzo Calderón*’s grave.  

He ran home, coin clutched in his fist. That night, he found the obituary in a 1954 newspaper: *Local Man Dies in Tragic Lawnmower Accident*. His photo stared back.  

The next day, 11:47. He mowed in a fog. At 11:52, a different man in a gray suit sat on the bench. Same silver coin. Same impossible spin.  

Renzo didn’t follow. He finished the lawn, went home, burned the newspaper. But the coin remained.  

Each day, the man appeared. Each day, Renzo resisted until noon. The visions worsened: a life where he’d married Eleanor Voss, another where he’d testified before a congressional committee, another where he simply vanished. The cemetery shifted—headstones rewriting themselves, graves swallowing wrong names.  

On the tenth day, Renzo kept the coin. The man in gray waited until 11:59, then walked into the woods. At noon, Renzo flipped the coin himself. It hung, spinning. The shadow detached, growing wings.  

He saw them then: dozens of men in gray suits, standing in a circle beyond the oaks. All of them watching him. All of them holding coins.  

The cost was not in knowing, but in being known.  

Renzo let the coin fall. It buried itself in the soil. He went home, packed a suitcase, left the keys on the counter.  

The cemetery kept its lawn trimmed. The man in the gray suit never returned.  

But sometimes, when the wind lifts, the name on the headstone wavers—just for a moment—like ink on wet paper.
