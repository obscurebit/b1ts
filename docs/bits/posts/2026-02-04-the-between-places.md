# The Between Places

Soojin’s notebook had a map drawn in pencil, the kind that only made sense if you knew which alleys to ignore and which fire escapes led nowhere. Diego followed her through the thirteenth arrondissement’s service corridors, complaining about the smell of stale bread and diesel. “This is a waste,” he said, kicking a peeling poster for a band that broke up years ago. “Your ‘unmapped’ spots are just dirty.”  

She didn’t answer. Her eyes were on the door.  

It wasn’t hidden, exactly—a plain thing with peeling green paint and a rusted handle—but it stood alone between a laundromat and a shuttered bakery, neither of which had existed the week before. Soojin touched the handle. It was warm.  

Inside, the air smelled like ozone and wet concrete. The ceiling vanished into fog. Buildings around them were half-formed: a Parisian balcony floating above a Tokyo streetlamp, a Buenos Aires café sign dangling over a Moscow subway grate. Time here was a mess. A clock tower chimed 3:07, then 10:22, then nothing.  

Diego whistled. “Okay. Not a waste.”  

They wandered. Soojin sketched a graffiti tag that pulsed like a heartbeat. Diego pocketed a coin from a gutter that glowed faintly blue. The space seemed to shift around them, corridors stretching, corners bending. Soojin’s compass spun wildly.  

Then they found the room.  

It was a perfect cube, lit by a sourceless amber glow. In the center sat a wooden table, scarred and familiar. On it: a pocket watch, its face cracked. Soojin reached for it.  

“Wait,” Diego said.  

But she’d already touched it.  

The walls shuddered. A low hum filled the air. The watch’s hands began to spin backward.  

“Uh,” Diego said, “I think we should—”  

The door was gone.  

They ran, the hum rising to a scream. The corridor twisted, dumping them back into the alley. The green door was now a brick wall. Soojin clutched the watch, its hands still spinning.  

Days later, she’d find the notes she’d taken inside the room—pages filled with symbols she didn’t recognize, and a single line in her own handwriting: *It’s not a place. It’s a pause.*  

Diego never mentioned the blue coin. But sometimes, when Soojin opened her notebook, she’d hear the faint chime of a clock that didn’t exist.  

The watch stopped moving entirely the day she tried to show it to someone else.
