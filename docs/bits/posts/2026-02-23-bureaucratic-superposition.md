# **Bureaucratic Superposition**

I don’t believe in time travel, which is why they hired me.  

—Clerk #47, 14:59:32  

The form says *Describe Anomalies*. I write: *Left hand occasionally becomes transparent. Suspect inadequate lighting.* Supervisor stamp: *Approved for Continued Observation.* My fingers tremble—translucency makes penmanship difficult. They’ve replaced the office bulbs three times. Never mention the teeth.  

—Dentist’s Assistant, 14:58:17  

Patient #8812 (Clerk #47) insists his molars are “shifting.” I check his X-rays: normal. He insists louder. I stamp *Hysterical Tension* and prescribe phenobarbital. My own left eye just split into two smaller eyes. I blink. They merge back. The clipboard hides my hands.  

—Supervisor Halvorsen, 14:57:04  

File #Q-ENT-55: Subjects exhibiting quantum entanglement symptoms. Protocol: Increase paperwork. Clerk #47’s reports now include “fingers fusing.” I initiate Form 12-B: Request for Additional Forms. Denial of benefits pending psychiatric evaluation. My stomach churns—a routine side effect of lunchroom pie. Or the way my intestines occasionally braid themselves.  

—Clerk #47, 14:56:39  

They moved my desk. Again. Or did I move? The grid lines on the carpet blur. I count tiles to stay focused: 17 east, 23 north. Supervisor says I’m “disoriented.” I stamp *Received: One Dose of Condescension.* My left leg dematerializes. I wait. It returns. I file the incident under *Weather-Related Fatigue.*  

—Dentist’s Assistant, 14:55:12  

Patient #8831 (Supervisor Halvorsen) complains of “internal knots.” I note *Chronic Constipation* and prescribe prune juice. His jaw dislocates mid-sentence. I stitch it shut with dental floss. He thanks me, voice muffled. My own spine unpivots—a slow, wet crack. I lean on the desk. It holds.  

—Supervisor Halvorsen, 14:54:03  

Memo from Director’s Office: *All personnel must verify corporeal integrity hourly.* I design Form 14-C: *Self-Certification of Solids.* Clerk #47 submits his with a smile—half his face lags three seconds behind. I approve it. My own certification is flawless. A lie. My liver is currently a fist-sized hummingbird.  

—Clerk #47, 14:53:21  

They’ve installed a mirror in the break room. *For morale.* I avoid it. The coffee tastes like copper. My shadow detaches, waves. I wave back. It sits. Supervisor Halvorsen walks by, leaves a trail of faint afterimages. I file an Incident Report. The typewriter keys bleed.  

—Dentist’s Assistant, 14:52:44  

Patient #8845 (Janitor) claims the trash cans “eat time.” I stamp *Schizophreniform Disorder* and confiscate his keys. His hands are webbed. I develop a sudden craving for fish. My scalp peels back. I adjust my hat. The patients are getting harder to distinguish from the walls.  

—Supervisor Halvorsen, 14:51:19  

The Director visits. Demands results. I show him Clerk #47’s latest form: *I am a loyal citizen of the United States and a properly configured human.* The Director nods. I nod. My left eye becomes a compass rose. It points east. The Director’s head tilts, birdlike. I stamp *Meeting Adjourned.*  

—Clerk #47, 14:50:00  

Final countdown. I submit my resignation in triplicate. Supervisor says nothing—his mouth is now a seam. I walk out. The sun hurts. My shadow stays behind, waving. I don’t look back. The form was wrong: I never had a left hand.  

The lie? Clerk #47 never filed that last resignation. I saw it in the trash, half-eaten by time.
