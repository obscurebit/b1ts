# The Duplicate Report

**To:** Renzo C.  
**From:** Mirror Archives, 42nd Floor  
**Contents:** 1x Envelope (Sealed), 3x Forms (Tripled), 1x Stamp (Invalid)  

Renzo C. did not believe in echoes. He believed in stamps, specifically the one missing from Form 42-B, which now lay on his desk like a dare. The envelope had arrived at 9:03 a.m., delivered by the pneumatic tube system that hissed like a dissatisfied cat. Inside, three identical forms, each bearing his name but different middle initials: C., D., E. The Stamp of Transit Authorization was blank, a white rectangle where the holographic eagle usually glinted.  

At 9:07 a.m., on the floor above, Fumiko W. spilled chamomile tea on her Report of Anomalies. The liquid spread across the page, blurring the categories: *Likely Coincidence*, *Routine Glitch*, *File for Review*. She dabbed at it with a lint roller from her desk drawer—used earlier that week to clean dust from her keyboard—and stared at the security camera in the corner of her cubicle. It winked a red light, then flickered off.  

Renzo called the Mirror Archives. Hold music played—a saxophone-heavy rendition of *"Yesterday"*—until a voice games "Department of Redundancy, how may we route your concern?"  

"I have tripled forms," Renzo said. "And a stamp that doesn’t exist."  

"Ah." The voice brightened. "Parallel submission. Common this time of year. Submit all paperwork to the Duplicate Resolution Slot."  

Fumiko’s phone rang. She didn’t recognize the extension: 42-R. A man’s voice, crackling, said, "I think we’re filling out the same form."  

"I’m not discussing this," Fumiko said, though she wasn’t sure why. The lint roller had left fuzzy trails on her report.  

Renzo located the Duplicate Resolution Slot: a mail chute labeled *For Echoes Only*. He hesitated, then fed the forms into it. The chute sighed.  

At 10:11 a.m., Fumiko found a physical copy of her report in the interoffice mail. It was identical except for a handwritten note on the back: *They’ll make us redundant if we don’t sync. —R.C.*  

She pulled open a drawer, rooting past paperclip bundles and a half-eaten matcha bar, until she found a blank form. She wrote, *How do we sync?* and slid it into the pneumatic tube.  

Renzo’s tube burbled at 10:17 a.m. Inside: a form with a smudged tea stain and three words in the margin: *Use the backup.*  

He glanced at his computer. The backup server was listed as *Unavailable (Mirror Maintenance)*. Always. But today, a new icon glowed: a broken mirror with a plus sign.  

Fumiko’s screen flickered. Her reflection in the dark glass raised two fingers in a peace sign. She raised hers back, instinctively.  

At 10:23 a.m., both submitted revised reports simultaneously. Renzo’s stamp appeared, suddenly valid, eagle glinting. Fumiko’s camera flicked back on, its red light steady.  

The forms married themselves in the system, merging into a single document titled *Resolution of Redundancy*. The Department of Redundancy archived it under "M."  

They never met. Renzo ate lunch at his desk—peanut butter sandwich, crusts cut off—while Fumiko attended a mandatory seminar on *Optimizing Parallel Workflow*.  

The forms, however, kept whispering through the tubes, echoing in the margins, their carbonless copies blurring into a third thing: neither his nor hers nor quite the institution’s, but something that hummed, quietly, in the gap between.  

By 5:00 p.m., the coffee machine in the 42nd-floor break room dispensed chamomile. No one noticed. Or everyone did. Paperwork, as always, was pending.
