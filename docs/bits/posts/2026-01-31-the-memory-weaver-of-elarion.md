# The Memory Weaver of Elarion

When Lira Voss stepped into the cavern beneath the village, she expected to find relics of the past—not a mirror that remembered her before she was born.  

The device hung suspended in a chamber of bioluminescent crystal, its surface swirling with threads of light that coiled like serpents. The villagers called it the Loom, a relic from the "Star-Seeders," an extinct civilization that supposedly planted humanity across the galaxy. Lira, a historian skeptical of myths, had come to debunk the legend. But as she approached, the Loom hummed to life, projecting a hologram of a woman with her face—except older, wearing a uniform from a starship she’d never seen.  

*“You’re finally here,”* the hologram said, voice trembling with relief. *“They’re coming. You have to reset the timeline again.”*  

Before Lira could speak, the Loom lashed out, tendrils of light piercing her temples. Memories flooded her: piloting a ship through a nebula, arguing with a crew about a failing experiment, watching a planet crumble into dust. These weren’t her memories. Yet her hands bore the calluses of a starship engineer. Her reflection in the mirror aged decades in seconds.  

The twist struck like a physical blow: *She was the Star-Seeder.* Not a descendant, but the original. The Loom wasn’t just storing memories—it was a time-loop device, resurrecting her consciousness into new bodies whenever humanity faced extinction. The villagers, with their shared, implanted recollections of her past lives, were her unwitting custodians.  

But something was wrong. The current loop was glitching. Fragments of her previous selves bled through—memories of building the Loom, of a partner who’d tried to stop her, of a catastrophic error that had erased entire civilizations from history. The “reset” wasn’t saving humanity. It was erasing it, strand by strand, as her looping consciousness overwritten reality itself.  

Lira stumbled back, the cavern trembling. The hologram reappeared, now frantic. *“You have to choose,”* it pleaded. *“Reset, or let it end.”*  

In the Loom’s core, she saw the truth: every reset spawned a parallel universe, each one a little more distorted, a little less real. Her immortality was a virus, fracturing existence. The Star-Seeders hadn’t planted life—they’d infected the cosmos with their desperation to survive.  

Lira reached into the Loom, her hands dissolving into light. She didn’t reset. Instead, she wove a final memory—a warning to any who might find the device, a plea to let go. As the cavern collapsed, she felt her consciousness unravel, not into a new body, but into the void between stars.  

Centuries later, explorers would find the Loom, now dark and inert, its mirror cracked. In its shards, they’d glimpse fleeting images: a woman’s face, a ship in flames, a planet healing. They’d call it a myth. But sometimes, in dreams, they’d remember a voice whispering, *“Let go.”*  

And they would.
