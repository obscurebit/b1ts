# Obscure Links - February 05, 2026

Today's curated discoveries from the hidden corners of the web.


## 1. "The Bizarre Thought Experiment Linking Quantum Physics to Immortality"

This Wikipedia article explores the "quantum suicide" hypothesis, a radical extension of the many-worlds interpretation where an observer in a quantum experiment could theoretically survive indefinitely through probabilistic branching of universes.

*It connects quantum physics to parallel universe theories in a provocative way, illustrating how thought experiments push the boundaries of interpretation. The article is obscure but deeply tied to foundational debates in quantum mechanics.*

## 2. "The U.S. Government’s Race to Save Encryption from Quantum Computers"

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) details its efforts to standardize quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, critical as quantum computing threatens to break current encryption methods.

*This page highlights real-world implications of quantum physics for cryptography, showcasing cutting-edge research by a trusted .gov source. The project is both urgent and little-known outside technical circles.*

## 3. "The Stanford Encyclopedia’s Deep Dive Into the Many-Worlds Interpretation"

A comprehensive philosophical analysis of Hugh Everett’s many-worlds theory, which posits that all quantum possibilities branch into parallel universes.

*This entry provides an academic yet accessible exploration of parallel universe theories, connecting quantum physics to cosmology. It’s a foundational resource often overlooked in mainstream discussions.*

## 4. "A Digital Time Capsule of Rare Quantum Physics Texts"

This Archive.org collection aggregates obscure books, lectures, and papers on quantum theory, including early 20th-century debates and speculative works on multiverse concepts.

*It offers a treasure trove of historical and niche material, linking quantum physics to parallel universe ideas through forgotten voices. Perfect for readers seeking hidden perspectives.*
