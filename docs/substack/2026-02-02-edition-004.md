### The Static Between

Amara adjusted the receiver’s dial, her fingers smudging the dusty panel. The attic hummed with the whir of old electronics—her grandfather’s hobbyist gear, never thrown out. She’d come to salvage what she could, but the radio’s hiss had stopped her mid-sigh. Buried beneath the static was a rhythm: three clicks, a pause, five clicks, another pause. Prime numbers. Not random.  

She leaned closer, the headphones pressing against her ears. The pattern shifted, resolving into something almost melodic—a sequence of tones that rose and fell like a question. Her dry-erase board already had two pages of scribbled notes. The signal originated somewhere local, but the towers she’d checked didn’t match its frequency.  

When Diego called, she didn’t answer. His text blinked on her phone: *Still chasing ghosts?* She ignored it.  

The next night, the signal changed.  

It began with a burst of white noise, then a voice—distorted, genderless, speaking in a language that wasn’t a language. Amara’s hands flew to the dials, refining the reception. The voice cycled through snippets of other transmissions: a child laughing, a train whistle, a burst of staticky jazz. Then silence.  

Then her own voice, from three days ago, muttering *“Dammit, why won’t you—”*  

She froze. The receiver was picking up her words, echoing them back with a delay. A conversation.

Diego met her at the old industrial park, skeptical until she played the recording. “Okay,” he said, adjusting his glasses, “that’s weird.”  

They followed the signal to a rusted water tower behind a shuttered factory. Amara’s Geiger counter ticked steadily—normal background radiation. Diego climbed first, rungs slick with dew. At the top, they found nothing. No antenna, no dish. Just a corroded platform and a single fiber-optic cable snaking into the ground.  

“It’s not transmitting,” Diego said. “It’s *receiving*.”  

Amara knelt, brushing moss off the cable’s connector. “Or bridging.”  

The signal started again as they descended. This time, it was a single phrase, repeated in perfect English: *“Do you hear us?”*

They answered.  

Diego rigged a microphone to the transmitter. Amara hesitated, then said, “Yes.”  

The reply was immediate: *“You are late.”*  

Late for what? They asked questions, but the voice only cycled through more fragments—a ticking clock, a woman reciting pi, a dog barking. When Amara demanded clarity, the signal dissolved into static.  

Days passed. The tower went silent.  

Then, at 3 a.m., Amara’s phone buzzed with a coordinates link. Diego’s name on the message. But he hadn’t sent it.  

The location was a field outside town, overgrown with weeds. In the center stood a structure they’d never noticed before—a low, curved arch, like a ribcage half-buried in earth. Its surface was smooth, metallic, but when Amara touched it, it warmed and depressed slightly, like skin.  

Diego tapped his flashlight against it. The sound echoed, hollow. “It’s not on any survey,” he whispered.  

They returned each night. The arch didn’t change. The signal didn’t return.  

But sometimes, when the wind shifted, Amara thought she heard a faint hum, just beyond the range of hearing. A vibration in her molars.  

She stopped sleeping.

Diego found her at the arch one morning, asleep against its base. “You look terrible,” he said.  

“You didn’t feel it?” she asked. “Last night. Like… a pause. In everything.”  

He shook his head.  

The next day, the arch was gone. Only a circle of dead grass remained.  

Amara still checks the receiver every evening. The static is just static now.  

But sometimes, when she’s alone, she hums a tune she’s never heard before—and the air seems to listen.  

---  

The Static Between stays with you, unexplained. A half-remembered dream. A question that doesn’t need an answer.
