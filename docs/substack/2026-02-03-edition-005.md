### The Nested Echo

Ji-Hwan found the VHS tape behind a stack of moth-eaten encyclopedias in his uncle’s basement. The label read *“For K, from K”* in smudged marker. His cousin Kofi snorted. “Your uncle was weird.”  

“He was a collector,” Ji-Hwan said, brushing dust from the plastic. “Of what? Junk?”  

The tape hissed when played, static blooming like snowfall before resolving into a grainy living room. A woman with Kofi’s nose and Ji-Hwan’s frayed nerves sat cross-legged on a rug, holding this exact VHS. “If you’re watching this,” she said, “we’re already inside.”  

Kofi leaned forward. “Inside what?”  

The woman—*future them*, Ji-Hwan realized with a lurch—held up a book. Its pages fluttered open to a diagram: concentric circles labeled *Narrative Layer 1, Layer 2, Etc.*. “Stories are Matryoshka dolls,” she said. “Each one holds another. We’re in one. You’re in ours.”  

Ji-Hwan paused the tape. The room felt smaller suddenly, the basement air thick with the scent of iron and old paper. “It’s a prank,” Kofi said, but his voice wavered.  

They watched the rest. Future-Ji-Hwan explained how their uncle had discovered a “narrative recursion”—a story that looped back into itself, infinitely. The woman demonstrated, inserting the tape into a second VCR. Static again, then a different room: a child’s bedroom. A boy opened a book, and the camera zoomed into the text, letters swelling into a new scene.  

“This is how it eats you,” future-Kofi said. “You keep going deeper, looking for the center. But there’s no center. Just reflections.”  

Ji-Hwan ejected the tape. His hands didn’t shake. “We should throw it out.”  

Kofi picked it up. “Or send it backward. See who *our* K is.”  

“Bad idea.”  

“Since when are you cautious?”  

They recorded over the tape, burning their own message: a shaky shot of the basement, Ji-Hwan’s voice saying, “If you’re watching, burn this.” They mailed it to Kofi’s address, three days prior.  

It arrived the next morning.  

The final scene plays in their minds like a stuck frame. Them, watching themselves watch the tape, ad infinitum. But sometimes, in the corner of a screen, a flicker—a third VCR, a fourth room. Layers they can’t reach.  

Ji-Hwan still checks the mail. Kofi won’t look at screens. The basement’s locked, but the key’s under the mat.  

They don’t talk about it.  

Some doors, once opened, don’t close. They just lead somewhere else.
