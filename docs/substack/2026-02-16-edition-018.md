## 📖 Today's Bit

### The Blue That Wasn’t

You remember the sky being blue, but that’s the first lie they planted.  

The library’s air tastes of mildew and burnt paper, though the fires died decades ago. You count the steps between shelves—thirty-seven to the fiction section, where spines gape like open mouths. Someone else’s footsteps echo in the biography aisle. You don’t look. Names here are unreliable.  

Across the city, in the rusted skeleton of the old transit hub, a woman sharpens a pencil with a butter knife. She writes on the back of a ration voucher: *They made us forget the color, not the word.* Her hands tremble. The pencil breaks. She uses her teeth.  

You find a book with no title. Its pages smell of bergamot and static-free air, a scent that shouldn’t exist. A sentence bleeds through the paper: *The sky was never blue. It was the color of unripe apricots.* You lick your thumb, rub the ink. It doesn’t smudge.  

The woman in the transit hub tapes her note to a pillar. A boy on a bicycle swerves to read it. His backpack holds three potatoes and a jar of wasps. He pedals away, note flapping in his wake.  

You hear a voice above the library’s silence: “You’re hallucinating again.” It’s Dr. Ngo, her lab coat stitched from curtains. She holds a vial of liquid that shouldn’t be green. “The archives are full of corrupted data.”  

“You’re the one who curated them,” you say.  

She smiles. Her left eye flickers, a glitch in the recording. “We gave you manageable pasts.”  

The woman in the transit hub lights a candle. Wax drips onto her note. The flame gutters, casting shadows that climb the walls like vines. A child’s laughter echoes, though no children remain.  

You open the book. The text shifts: *Memory is a muscle. Use it or lose it.* A page tears itself free, drifts to the floor. On the back, a map of the city before the collapse. A route is marked in apricot-colored ink.  

The boy on the bicycle skids to a stop at the library steps. He throws a stone through the window. It strikes the floor where you’re kneeling, bursts into petals of paper. One scrap has your name, misspelled.  

Dr. Ngo presses a syringe to your neck. “This will fix the feedback loop.”  

You grab her wrist. The green liquid spills on the floor, hisses where it eats into the wood. “What’s in it?”  

“Everything you don’t need to remember.”  

The woman in the transit hub closes her eyes. The candle dies. In the sudden dark, she whispers the color she can’t name.  

You twist away from Dr. Ngo, knock over a shelf. Books avalanche, pages flying like frightened birds. One lands open on *apricot*—a fruit that never grew here, according to the official records.  

The boy outside laughs. His backpack rustles. A wasp emerges, circles the broken window. It hums a tune your mother used to sing.  

Dr. Ngo’s eye glitches again. For a split second, you see her as she was: a librarian, not a scientist, shelving books by candlelight.  

You pick up the map. Follow the apricot ink.  

The woman in the transit hub walks into the night, her shadow detaching to wait by the pillar. The boy pedals after her, wasps trailing like a bridal train.  

You step over the threshold, into the hum of a world that never stopped remembering.
