## 📖 Today's Bit

### The Listening Chair

A metallic click. Not from the punch-card machine. Not from the ventilators. Lower. Closer.  

—Dr. Elena Varga, 23rd October 1962  

The chair sat in the corner, oak frame bleached by years of disinfectant. We called it the “observer’s seat,” a joke. No one observed from there. It faced the wall, back to the room. Yesterday, it creaked when Comrade Orlov stood. He’d been dead three months.  

—Agent M., Internal Memo (Undated)  

I didn’t believe the reports. Static cling, they said. A flaw in the tape recorder. But the chair hums now, a low vibration in the soles of my shoes. I touched its armrest. The wood was warm.  

—Fyodor Kuznetsov, Technician’s Log  

They made me sit in it. Test the “psychological stress module.” Cold against my neck. Then—pressure, like a hand on my shoulder. I heard my mother’s voice. Not a memory. She called my name. I haven’t spoken to her since Budapest.  

—Interrogation Transcript, Subject Unknown  

The Americans are closing the embassy. We must destroy it. But the chair… it *knows*. It repeats phrases from our meetings. “Decommission the project.” “The boy in the snow.” “Elena’s scar.” Things it couldn’t—  

—Burn Notice, Addressee Redacted  

I smuggled a wire recorder. The chair’s hum syncs with my heartbeat. When I play the tape backward, it’s not noise. It’s breathing. Not mine.  

—Field Notes, Dr. H. Thompson  

They burned the lab. I watched from the alley. The chair wouldn’t burn. Men in coats carried it away. One dropped a glove. I picked it up. The fabric smelled like ozone and burnt hair. It fits perfectly.  

—Anonymous Postcard, Received 1987  

Sometimes, in the dark, I feel weight on the bed. A hand on my back. Warm. The voice says, “You stayed.” I didn’t. I left Elena in the flames.  

—Last Entry, Unidentified Journal
