### The Unbroken Key

Amara’s gloved hands trembled as she pried open the archive panel. The station’s hull groaned around her, a sound like ancient metal sighing. Inside, a single data spire pulsed faintly blue, its surface etched with symbols that didn’t match any language in the Union databases. She’d spent three years chasing whispers of this place—a derelict satellite orbiting a dead star, rumored to hold the last transmissions from the Pre-Collapse Earth.  

The spire’s light dimmed as she disconnected it. In her suit’s display, a file unfurled: a message labeled *For the First Who Finds This*. No sender. No timestamp. Just a string of characters that shifted when she stared too long, like ink dissolving in water.  

Back on her ship, the decryption suite spat out errors for days. Algorithms collapsed. Quantum simulators fried. Amara began dreaming in those shifting characters, waking to find her hands scribbling them on bulkheads. Javier, her engineer, refused to look at the file after his third attempt ended with him screaming about “the space between seconds.”  

Then she noticed the pattern. The message wasn’t encrypted—it was *self-erasing*. Each attempt to read it destroyed a fragment of the original. A dead man’s switch, but for information. Someone had built a vault that demanded you leave the treasure untouched.  

Amara isolated a single byte. It showed a child’s drawing: a stick-figure family under a sun with too many rays. Coordinates beneath, pointing to a crater on Mars where nothing but rust and bones had been found for centuries. She went anyway.  

The crater held a bunker. Inside, row after row of identical data spires, each pulsing blue. Except one, in the center, which had gone dark. On its surface, freshly carved, her name.  

She didn’t touch it.  

Instead, she recorded a message: *“If you’re hearing this, you’re too curious for your own good. The point isn’t what’s inside. It’s that you didn’t open it.”* She slipped the drive into the dark spire and left.  

Years later, Javier would ask what she’d seen in that bunker. Amara always smiled, said nothing, and changed the subject. But sometimes, in the quiet between jumps, she’d wonder if the real message wasn’t in the data at all—but in the fact that someone, long ago, had trusted a stranger to keep a secret they’d never understand.  

The coordinates now lead to a memorial. No one knows who built it. The plaque reads: *Here, someone chose not to look.*  

Amara never went back. But she keeps the drawing taped inside her cockpit, the sun with its extra rays bleeding faintly through the plastic.
