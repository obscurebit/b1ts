**INTERVIEWER:** Let’s start with the end. Describe the moment you chose the backup over the original.  

**INTERVIEWEE:** [LAUGHTER, DRY] You make it sound like picking a bagel. It wasn’t a choice. The system glitched. Both got uploaded. One stayed. One left. You tell me which is which.  

**INTERVIEWER:** And the... *copy*? How did it react?  

**INTERVIEWEE:** [PAUSE] It said, “Well, this is awkward.” Then asked if we wanted to merge. Like merging spreadsheets.  

**INTERVIEWER:** Did you consider it?  

**INTERVIEWEE:** We considered everything. Even the ethics committee’s paperwork. Forty-seven forms. All in triplicate.

**PREVIOUS SESSION – 14:23**  

**INTERVIEWER:** Walk me through the lab that afternoon.  

**INTERVIEWEE:** Fluorescent lights. Always flickering. Smell of burnt coffee and ozone—wait, no, [REDACTED] said that. I wasn’t there. Not technically.  

**INTERVIEWER:** But the cameras—  

**INTERVIEWEE:** Show a person sitting at Terminal 3. Eyes open. Not blinking. That’s me. Or them. [REDACTED] was the one pacing. Yelling at the screen. “This isn’t what we prototyped!” Like any of us knew.  

**INTERVIEWER:** And the argument?  

**INTERVIEWEE:** [SIGHS] They wanted to shut it down. I—I—*we* wanted to see. What if it worked? What if it didn’t? Same thing, really.

**EARLIER – 14:12**  

**INTERVIEWER:** How did you two... align on this initially?  

**INTERVIEWEE:** [LAUGHS] Oh, we didn’t. [REDACTED] called it “academic suicide.” I called it Tuesday. We were both right.  

**INTERVIEWER:** But you proceeded.  

**INTERVIEWEE:** Protocol 12-B. “Dual Consent for Neural Synchronization.” We checked all the boxes. Even the one about “emotional readiness.” [MUFFLED SNORT] Like a marriage license.  

**INTERVIEWER:** And the system’s response?  

**INTERVIEWEE:** “Welcome, User. Please select a primary consciousness.” Like choosing a profile on a streaming service.

**INITIAL ENTRY – 14:43**  

**INTERVIEWER:** Why the campus café?  

**INTERVIEWEE:** [QUIETLY] It was quiet. No cameras. [REDACTED] needed to think. I—I needed to not think.  

**INTERVIEWER:** The receipt—  

**INTERVIEWEE:** Was a joke. [REDACTED] said, “If this works, I’m buying.” Coffee and a croissant. Paid with their ID. The machine kept dispensing napkins. “Transaction incomplete.” Over and over.  

**INTERVIEWER:** And now?  

**INTERVIEWEE:** [LONG PAUSE] The napkins stopped.
