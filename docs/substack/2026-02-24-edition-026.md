## 📖 Today's Bit

### The Aerialist's Requiem

[Transcript Excerpt: Interview #472-B, Redacted]  

Interviewer: You’re certain this is the location?  

Subject: (pauses) The coordinates matched the schematic. Or what’s left of it. (sound of wind, paper rustling)  

Interviewer: Describe the area.  

Subject: Rooftop garden. Neglected. There’s a fountain with a cracked mermaid, ivy strangling the basin. Beyond that, the city—neon signs bleeding into fog. (lower voice) And the tower. They built it to look like a radio mast, but it’s not.  

Interviewer: How do you know?  

Subject: (laughs bitterly) Because I’ve spent six years chasing the ghosts of men who thought they could bottle the aether. This is their work. All of it. (pause) The metal sings when you press your ear to it. Not a hum—don’t look at me like that, I know the rules—but a vibration in the bones. Like a cello played by a ghost.  

Interviewer: And the device?  

Subject: (papers shuffling) Here. In the fountain. Wrapped in oilcloth, buried under three inches of sludge. (voice tight) It’s intact. Too intact.  

Interviewer: Functionality?  

Subject: That’s the joke, isn’t it? (metallic clink) Every time I think I’ve aligned the prongs correctly, it rejects the current. Or accepts it, then… spits it back. (static-free silence) Yesterday, it burned through three wires. Today, it froze the soldering iron solid.  

Interviewer: Sabotage?  

Subject: (longer pause) Worse. Incompetence. Mine. (wind whistles) The schematics are a dead language. I translate, but the words shift. Last night, I swear the symbols rearranged themselves. (nervously) You hear that?  

Interviewer: Hear what?  

Subject: (overlapping) No—earlier. A voice. Through the tower’s receiver. Just a fragment: “Adjust the azimuth.” But the transmitter’s been dead since ’37.  

Interviewer: You’re exhausted. Hallucinations—  

Subject: (shouting) Don’t. (breathes deeply) There’s a log. Hidden in the base. Entries from the original team. (paper tears) They called it “the aerialist.” Said it didn’t transmit signals—it *translated* them. Between worlds. (voice cracks) They stopped writing after Entry #43. The last line: “It wants to balance the scales.”  

Interviewer: And you believe this?  

Subject: (quietly) I’ve seen the scales. (metal groans) Every failure resets the field. The fountain overflows with rain that hasn’t fallen yet. The mermaid’s crack heals, then splits again. (pause) I think it’s trying to correct itself. Through me.  

Interviewer: Then stop. Walk away.  

Subject: (distant, almost amused) You don’t get it, do you? (sound of gears grinding, a low harmonic) I’m the only one left who remembers how to listen. (wind rises) The aerialist’s still performing. Even if the audience is dead.  

[End Transcript. Note: Subject unresponsive to further queries. Device recovered but nonfunctional. Rooftop structure condemned subsequent to interview.]
