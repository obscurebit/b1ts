<div class="about-page">
  <p class="about-lead">
    <em>Obscure Bit</em> is a daily destination for the curious—those who crave something beyond the algorithmic feed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every day, we surface <strong>interesting links</strong> from the forgotten, weird, and wonderful corners of the web. The kind of content that doesn't trend, doesn't go viral, but rewards those who find it.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also publish a <strong>Daily Bit</strong>—a short AI-generated story exploring sci-fi, mysteries, and speculative ideas. Think of it as a small adventure for your imagination, delivered fresh each morning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Everything here is automated. No editors, no algorithms optimizing for engagement. Just interesting things, every day.
