Image: Gadget Review Key Takeaways Have you heard about the inventors who changed the world, then vanished? Nikola Tesla built a tower to send free electricity worldwide, but his financial backers quickly pulled the plug when they realized the implications. Then there was Rudolf Diesel, who created engines running on common vegetable oils right before his mysterious disappearance in 1913. And don\u2019t forget Henry Ford, who actually engineered a car made from plant fibers that could take hammer blows better than steel. These brilliant minds dared to challenge powerful industries with ideas that threatened the status quo. What really happened to these game-changing technologies? Their forgotten stories reveal the hidden forces that can squash innovation when profits are at stake. 16. Radiant Energy Device Image: Gadget Review 50,000 watts of power from thin air? Dr. T. Henry Moray\u2019s Radiant Energy Device allegedly did just that in the 1930s, harvesting energy from space when most people were still marveling at electric toasters. Communist infiltration within the Rural Electrification Agency took the blame from Moray for his funding troubles. Government pressure to share his technology with the Soviet Union supposedly derailed his work as well. While Moray\u2019s device gained notoriety in alternative energy circles, it lacked scientific validation and never reached mass production. The Smithsonian Magazine and IEEE Spectrum have documented his work as part of the controversial history of \u201cfree energy\u201d devices. 15. Hendershot Generator Image: Resonant Fractals If you\u2019re fascinated by devices that break the laws of physics, Lester Hendershot\u2019s generator promised unlimited energy without fuel or external input\u2014a claim that attracted aviation hero Charles Lindbergh himself. No one but Hendershot himself appeared able to make it work during his 30-year quest. Increasing scrutiny eventually led to Hendershot and his invention disappearing from public view. Despite the attention it received, the Hendershot Generator lacked independent verification and scientific evidence. It remains a subject of interest in fringe science communities but has never been replicated under controlled conditions. 14. Nikola Tesla\u2019s Wireless Energy Transmission Image: Picryl.com The towering 187-foot Wardenclyffe Tower could have delivered free electricity worldwide, eliminating the need for power lines and democratizing energy access for generations to come. Earth itself would serve as a conductor for wireless power transmission in Tesla\u2019s ambitious plan built between 1901-1902 . Financial backers eventually pulled the plug when they realized free energy wouldn\u2019t exactly boost their profit margins. The project collapsed and the tower was demolished in 1917 due to financial issues. Though never fully operational, Tesla\u2019s vision inspired ongoing research in wireless power transmission, as documented by IEEE Spectrum and the Smithsonian Magazine. 13. Williams X-Jet Image: Wikimedia Commons | ZLEA | License Stuck in rush hour traffic? The Williams X-Jet of the 1980s offered a tantalizing solution\u2014personal flight at 60 mph using a compact turbofan engine and your own body movements as controls. Pilots controlled the craft by shifting their body weight, turning flight into a workout resembling Pilates. With a 45-minute flight time, the device showed promise as personal transportation. Despite its innovative compact design and simplified control system, the U.S. Army deemed it less effective than helicopters or drones. According to the Vertical Flight Society and National Air and Space Museum, the X-Jet never reached mass production and remained primarily an experimental concept. 12. Hemp Car Image: Wikimedia Commons | License Dwindling oil supplies worried Henry Ford, so he engineered a revolutionary solution in 1941 \u2014a car body made from plant fibers that could withstand hammer blows better than steel while running on hemp ethanol. Achieving approximately 40 mpg and costing just $600 to prototype, the Hemp Car demonstrated remarkable efficiency. Oil industry opposition quickly mounted against cars potentially running on easily grown plants. Political pressure and regulations effectively shelved the design. According to History.com and the Henry Ford Museum, the car served as a proof of concept for alternative fuel vehicles but never reached mass production, remaining an intriguing \u201cwhat if\u201d in automotive history. 11. General Motors EV1 Image: FLickr | RightBrainPhoto | License A drag coefficient of just 0.19 made GM\u2019s EV1 more aerodynamic than most sports cars when it silently rolled onto California roads in 1996 , promising a future without gasoline or emissions. A cultlike following developed among the 800 customers who leased them in California and Arizona. Nevertheless, GM recalled and destroyed nearly all EV1s by 2003 , citing \u201cprofitability concerns.\u201d Nothing says corporate vision quite like destroying the future to protect the past. According to IEEE Spectrum\u2019s \u201cWho Killed the Electric Car?\u201d and GM\u2019s own archives, the EV1\u2019s termination sparked controversy and protests. The program\u2019s demise set electric vehicle development back years\u2014a delay we\u2019re still reckoning with today. 10. Royal Raymond Rife\u2019s Cancer Research Image: Bakamakyan | License Microscopes capable of seeing live viruses and a device that destroyed cancer cells without harming healthy tissue? Rife\u2019s technology promised medical miracles that the scientific establishment ultimately rejected. Documentation and scientific validation remain absent for claims about a 1934 clinical trial at USC showing successful treatment of 14 out of 16 terminal cancer patients. Modern medical authorities have not approved Rife machines for treating cancer, and mainstream medicine rejected his methods. While supporters argue his work was suppressed by the American Medical Association, the lack of formal medical credentials and reproducible data undermined Rife\u2019s credibility. His approaches remain classified as pseudoscience by the scientific community. 9. Harry Hoxsey\u2019s Cancer Treatment Image: Amazon Conventional cancer treatments often came with devastating side effects, prompting Harry Hoxsey to develop herbal formulas in the 1920s that claimed to cure cancer gently\u2014claims that eventually led to an FDA ban in 1960 . Studies finding the treatment ineffective and potentially dangerous drove the FDA\u2019s decision. Potassium iodide, one ingredient, could actually accelerate tumor growth. Interestingly, the NIH later acknowledged some herbs in the formula had anti-cancer properties, though not as a cure. Despite warnings from the American Cancer Society, a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico still offers the treatment. The controversy highlights the complex relationship between traditional remedies and evidence-based medicine. 8. Project XA Image: Gadget Review If you\u2019ve ever wondered why tobacco companies didn\u2019t make safer cigarettes sooner, Dr. James D. Mold\u2019s Project XA demonstrates how Philip Morris actually developed one in the 1960s, then buried it to avoid liability issues. Executives at the tobacco company terminated the project in 1968 . They worried that admitting cigarettes could be safer implied their current products were dangerous, raising liability concerns for past products. According to BMJ Tobacco Control and research published in The Lancet, this innovative project never reached the market or consumer testing phase, though it contributed to ongoing debates about tobacco harm reduction. 7. Perpetual Motion / Vortex Water Revitalizer Image: Vortex Water Revitalizer Drinking lifeless tap water? Austrian naturalist Viktor Schauberger believed his Vortex Water Revitalizer could restore water\u2019s natural energy through spiral movements, mimicking the swirling patterns found in mountain streams. Obsession with water dynamics and vortex energy drove Schauberger\u2019s work in the 1930s-40s . The naturalist studied what he called \u201cliving water,\u201d developing theories about water\u2019s behavior that challenged conventional science. According to the Journal of Scientific Exploration and Water Research publications, Schauberger\u2019s ideas continue to influence niche markets and alternative health communities, though they lack scientific validation in mainstream research. 6. Cloudbuster Image: Wikimedia | Dennis Redfield | License Ending droughts with metal pipes pointed at the sky sounds absurd, yet Wilhelm Reich\u2019s Cloudbuster claimed exactly this power by manipulating what he called \u201corgone energy\u201d in the atmosphere. Equipment seizure and destruction by the FDA in 1956 ended Reich\u2019s experiments, and he died in prison the following year. Mainstream meteorology has rejected the concept of orgone energy, and no reputable scientific evidenc",
