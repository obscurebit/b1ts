This list shares 18 ideas and gadgets that were created early but didn\u2019t get the attention they deserved. They were clever, useful, and full of potential, just a little too soon. Today, they feel like a glimpse into the future that never was. 1. The Antikythera Mechanism (2nd Century BCE) Tilemahos Efthimiadis on Wikimedia Commons Discovered in a shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, this intricate device is considered the world\u2019s first analog computer. It could predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades in advance, showcasing the advanced engineering of ancient Greece. 2. Hero\u2019s Steam Engine (1st Century CE) Gts-tg on Wikimedia Commons Invented by Hero of Alexandria, the aeolipile was a steam-powered device that demonstrated the principles of jet propulsion. Despite its potential, it was viewed as a novelty rather than a practical invention during its time. 3. Damascus Steel (12th-18th Century) Pittigrilli on Wikimedia Commons Damascus steel, renowned for its strength and unique patterns, was used to create superior blades. Over time, the original method of production was lost, leaving modern metallurgists to speculate on its secrets. 4. Greek Fire (7th Century) Gts-tg on Wikimedia Commons A formidable incendiary weapon used by the Byzantine Empire, Greek fire could continue burning even on water. Its exact composition remains a mystery, as the formula was a closely guarded secret. 5. Claw of Archimedes (3rd Century BCE) Giulio Parigi on Wikimedia Commons Designed to defend the city of Syracuse, this device purportedly lifted and capsized enemy ships. While its existence is debated, it exemplifies the innovative military engineering attributed to Archimedes. 6. Stradivarius Violins (17th-18th Century) MBisanz talk on Wikimedia Commons Crafted by Antonio Stradivari, these violins are famed for their unparalleled sound quality. Despite numerous studies, the exact techniques and materials used remain elusive to modern luthiers. 7. Flexible Glass (1st Century CE) Ezhuttukari at Malayalam Wikipedia on Wikimedia Commons According to legend, a Roman artisan created a type of glass that wouldn\u2019t shatter. Fearing its impact on precious metals\u2019 value, Emperor Tiberius allegedly suppressed the invention, and its method was lost. 8. Pneumatic Subway (1870) Scientific American, March 5, 1870. (Originally in Frank Leslie\u2019s Illustrated Newspaper, February 19, 1870.) on Wikimedia Commons Alfred Ely Beach\u2019s Beach Pneumatic Transit in New York City was an early attempt at underground transportation using air pressure. Despite successful trials, it failed to gain long-term support. 9. Telautograph (1888) National Museum of American History; Smithsonian Institution on Wikimedia Commons Invented by Elisha Gray, the telautograph allowed the transmission of handwritten messages over telegraph lines, a precursor to the fax machine. It saw limited use due to the rise of more efficient technologies. 10. Baby Cage (1930s) Inventor Emma Read, by Watson E. Coleman Attorney. on Wikimedia Commons Designed to provide fresh air to infants in urban apartments, these cages were attached to windows. While popular for a time, safety concerns eventually led to their decline. 11. Dynasphere (1930) book author J. T. Goddard; illustrator unknown on Wikimedia Commons This monowheel vehicle, resembling a giant wheel with a driver inside, was invented by John Archibald Purves as a futuristic mode of transport. However, stability and steering issues hindered its practicality. 12. Monowheel Tank (1917) Norbert Schnitzler on Wikimedia Commons This was an experimental military vehicle consisting of a single large wheel housing the driver and weaponry. Despite its innovative design, it was impractical for combat situations. 13. GM EV1 Electric Car (1996) RegionVisitor90 on Wikimedia Commons The EV1 was one of the first mass-produced electric vehicles, offering impressive performance. However, it was discontinued, and most units were destroyed, sparking controversy and conspiracy theories. 14. Tesla\u2019s Wireless Power (1890s) Unknown author on Wikimedia Commons Nikola Tesla envisioned a world powered by wireless electricity and demonstrated early success. His Wardenclyffe Tower was meant to transmit energy globally, but funding cuts and skepticism halted the dream. 15. Moller Skycar (2000s) Jeff McNeill on Wikimedia Commons A futuristic flying car prototype, the Moller Skycar promised personal air travel. Despite decades of development and millions in investment, it never reached commercial production. 16. Betamax (1975) AndyHemmerCincinnati on Wikimedia Commons Sony\u2019s Betamax offered better video quality than its VHS rival but lost the format war due to licensing issues and shorter recording times. It remains a classic example of a superior invention that failed commercially. 17. LaserDisc (1978) Edward Wilders on Wikimedia Commons Laserdiscs were one of the first optical disc storage formats, offering crisp picture quality long before DVDs. However, despite their technical advantage, high costs and large size limited their adoption. 18. Sega Dreamcast (1999) Evan-Amos on Wikimedia Commons The Dreamcast introduced online gaming and innovative features ahead of its time. Despite critical acclaim, it was overshadowed by competitors and marked Sega\u2019s exit from the console business.
